                The ASSIST/UNA software is a Windows-based emulator of the
                ASSIST/I assembler for the IBM/360 machine. This software provides 
                a graphical environment in which to write
                assembly language programs. The ASSIST/UNA software is meant to
                be used primarily by students enrolled in assembly language courses.

            <a id="Assemble">
                <h2> 2.0 Assembling a Program </h2>
            </a>
            <p>
                When assembling a program in ASSIST/UNA, it is vital that you understand the differences 
                between each assembly option. This section covers how to most efficiently utilize each assembly 
                option. It also covers how to view both the .PRT and the output window.
            </p>
            <h3> - 2.1 Assemble and Generate a .PRT File </h3>
            <p>
                The main purpose of this option is to allow you to quickly assemble your source 
                code and check the .PRT file for any errors that may be present within your code.<br /> 
                <b>Warning: </b>Assembly does not generate any program output.<br />
                To begin Assembly:
                <ol>
                    <li>Click the <b>Assemble</b> button on toolbar or select <b>Assemble &#8594 
                        Assemble</b>. (F2)</li>
                    <li>The source code is assembled and a .PRT file is generated.</li>
                    <li>The generated .PRT file will have the same name as your project file.</li>
                    <li>Any errors found in the source code will be reported in the .PRT file.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <h3> - 2.2 Assemble and Debug </h3>
            <p>
                This option allows you to step through your program as it is simulated. This option generates 
                program output.<br />
                <b>Warning: </b>This option temporarily generates a .PRT file before deleting it.<br />
                To begin Debugging:
                <ol>
                    <li>Click the arrow next to the <b>Assembly</b> button on the toolbar and select
                    <b>Assemble and Debug</b> from the drop-down menu. Alternatively, you can select <b>
                        Assemble &#8594 Assemble and Debug</b> in the top menu. (F3)</li>
                    <li>After assembly has begun, use the <b>Next</b> button to step through each line. (F5)</li>
                    <li>If you want to stop debugging, click the <b>Stop</b> button. (F8)</li>
                    <li>If you would like to completely run through your program in debug mode, click 
                    <b>Run To End</b>. (F7)</li>
                    <li>If you would like to run to a specific location, without executing the instruction,
                        you may select the <b>Run To Location</b> option. (F6)</li>
                    <li>As each statement is executed, both the Registers Display and the Memory 
                        Display will be updated.</li>
                    <li>After assembly is completed, the Symbol Table Display will update and show the 
                    symbol table contents.</li>
                    <li>All output generated by the program will be displayed in the Output Dialog Window. Any 
                    runtime exceptions will be reported in the temporary .PRT file and in the Output Dialog Window.</li>
                </ol> 
            </p>
            <h3> - 2.3 Assemble/Final Run </h3>
            <p>
                This option allows you to assemble and execute your source code. This option generates output
                and a .PRT file.<br />
                To begin a Final Run:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Click the arrow next to the <b>Assembly</b> button on the toolbar and select
                        <b>Assemble/Final Run</b> from the drop-down menu. Alternatively, you can select <b>
                            Assemble &#8594 Assemble/Final Run</b> in the top menu. (F4)</li>
                    <li>A text box will appear prompting you for an identifier. This identifier will appear
                    at the top of your .PRT file.</li>
                    <li>Once assembly completes, the symbol table contents will be updated.</li>
                    <li>The program will completely assemble without interruption, regardless of whether or not
                         the source program has errors.</li>
                    <li>Once execution concludes, both the Registers Display and the Memory Display will be updated.</li>
                    <li>Any output generated by the program will be displayed in the .PRT file and the Output 
                    Dialog Window. All errors will be reported in the both windows.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <h3><b>Important Note:</b></h3>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The maximum number of errors supported in the assembler is 300.</li>
                    <li>The maximum number of symbols in one program is 100.</li>
                    <li>The maximum number of literals: 50 + (50 * number of LTORGs).</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h3> - 2.4 View .PRT File </h3>
            <p>
                The .PRT file associated with your project will share the same name as your project file.<br />
                <b>Reminder:</b> Only the <b>Assemble</b> and <b>Assemble/Final Run</b> options will generate 
                a permanent .PRT file.
                To view the .PRT file:<br />
                <ol>
                    <li>Click the <b>View .PRT</b> button on the toolbar, or select <b>Tools &#8594 View 
                        .PRT</b>. (F9)</li>
                    <li>If a .PRT has been generated, then a window will open containing it.</li>
                </ol>
                <b>Important Note:</b> An automatic TITLE is generated in the .PRT every 45 lines.
            </p>
            <h3> - 2.5 View Output Dialog Window </h3>
            <p>
                This displays all errors and output generated by the simulator.<br />
                <b>Reminder:</b> Only the <b>Assemble and Debug</b> and <b>Assemble/Final Run</b> options will 
                produce program output.
                To view output:<br />
                <ol>
                    <li>After using either <b>Assemble and Debug</b> or <b>Assemble/Final Run</b>, the output
                    window will automatically be displayed.</li>
                    <li>If you would like to manually view the output window, select <b>Tools &#8594 Output</b>

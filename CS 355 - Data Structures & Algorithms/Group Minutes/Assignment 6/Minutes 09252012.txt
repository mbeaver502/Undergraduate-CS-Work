Members: Drew, Andrew, Michael, Elizabeth
Time: 4:00pm - 6:00pm

* Discussed ways to implemented a Print routine for Binary Search Tree
	-- How to traverse the sub-trees while outputting each value

* Worked out the logic to Print In Order
	-- Andrew Hamilton figured out the logic to perform an In Order print
	-- Tried different implementations of code
	-- Tried different code logic to traverse left sub-tree of BST
	-- Had difficulty figuring out how to go down the right side of the left sub-tree of the BST
	-- After numerous failures, looked online for help
	-- Our efforts were somewhat more complex than necessary
	-- Adapted a solution from David Eck (http://math.hws.edu/eck/cs225/s03/binary_trees/)
		-- Eck's solution is a basic recursive implementation of our logic, whereas our efforts were overtly complex and difficult to trace (not to mention wrong)

* Worked out the logic for Preorder Print and Postorder Print
	-- Copied and adjusted the code from PrintInOrder as necessary

* Andrew Hamilton implemented GoToBeginning and GoToEnd

* Used Michael's iterative implementation of Insert rather than recursive implementation
	-- Already implemented ahead of time, so kept it

* Drew and Andrew implemented AtCursor

* Everyone implemented BNode's GetData and BST's Empty methods

* Everyone implemented BNode's constructors and BST's constructor

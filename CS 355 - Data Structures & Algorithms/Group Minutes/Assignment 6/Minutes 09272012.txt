Time: 4:00pm - 5:00pm

* Michael finished GoToPrev and respective helper routine
	-- Recursive In Order search for previous Node

* Discussed different ways to implement CopyList
	-- Recursive with call to Insert
		-- Loops inside loops => inefficient
	-- Recursive Pre Order insertion copy
		-- Gets root(s), left subtree(s), and right subtree(s)
		-- Works for BSTs
		-- Forgot to implement check for source list's cursor location
			-- Fixed => now functions properly

Group Members: Andrew, Drew, Michael, and Elizabeth (Skype)
Time: 4:00pm - 6:30pm

* Michael implemented recursive ClearList method and helper routine

* Andrew implemented iterative Find method

* Discussing different ways to implement GoToNext
	-- Iterative x
	-- Different versions of recursion
		-- Using tripped flags
		-- Some work for specific cases, not all cases
	-- Load tree in order into a dynamic array, the next value is the one directly after the one at the cursor
		-- Can be incredibly inefficient with large trees
		-- Includes potentially wasteful amount of memory for potentially have the tree that is unnecessary (e.g., left sub-tree if cursor is in right sub-tree)
	-- Got very close to working
